I am working on my project's team Front End part. As we are said to work on Heroku to develop our Front end part, first and foremost thing I created an account on Heroku(www.heroku.com). Heroku is a PaaS that means it serves as a platform where we deploy our application. I have decided to develop a nodejs application and deploy it on Heroku. We can design the View in HTML and develop the controller code in JS.  After I signed up for Heroku, I selected nodejs as a primary language to develop my application. There are various other programming languages available such as Ruby, Java, PHP, Python, Go, Scala, Clojure etc. I went with nodejs because as Professor is explaining nodejs in the class and I can learn something new.

Getting Started on Heroku with Node.js:

There are some steps available in Heroku Dev Center.(https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction)

The steps required installation of nodejs and npm locally in my system, so I installed Nodejs V4.4.2 LTS for Windows.

There I tried basic console level functions like

console.log("hello world!");

var foo = 3;

var bar = 5;

console.log(foo + 1);

console.log(foo / bar);

console.log(foo * bar);

console.log(foo - bar);

console.log(foo % 2);

The next step is to download Heroku Tool belt for windows from where I can deploy my applications. Once installed I can use 'heroku' command from my command prompt to access heroku.

-->'heroku login' command for authentication. I provided my heroku account details.

Heroku develop center has a sample app which I deployed to learn how we can deploy an app in Heroku.

The app is present in a GitHub repository(https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started)

-->'git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git'

-->'cd node-js-getting-started' These commands help us to clone the sample application.

Now to deploy the App,

-->'heroku create' --this creates a Heroku app to receive my source code.

When I create an app, a git remote called heroku is also created and linked to my local git repository. heroku generates a random name to our app, or I can pass the name as a parameter above.

-->'git push heroku master'--Application is now deployed.

-->'heroku ps:scale web=1' to ensure that at least one instance of the app is running.

-->'heroku open' to visit the app at the URL generated by the app's name.(https://nameless-meadow-42283.herokuapp.com)

So, what I understood from this is we need a GitHub repository for our code or we can place it in Dropbox. As we have a shared GitHub repository we can clone it into heroku and deploy our application here.

From the examples in the ppt's given by professor I created a simple server in nodejs.

I have placed this code in my team's shared repository under misc/kalyani

We have placed a folder misc in our team shared repository to place our non-project related stuff.

I used eclipse for this and installed Nodejs plugin to create nodejs projects. This way I can test my nodejs code in my local system by using Node Eclipse. I need to practice more on writing code in nodejs. By next week I will get an idea of my project architecture and proceed with my front end development.
