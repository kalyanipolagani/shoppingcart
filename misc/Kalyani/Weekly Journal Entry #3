As a part of my team's Front End Part, I have started my Express Node Project in Eclipse. 
I have uploaded the code and notes which I have made in Misc/Kalyani folder of our projectâ€™s GitHub repository. 
This week I have developed sample web pages and wrote the code for retrieval and storing of data from backend. 
In first step I retrieved data from mongo db from my local system and displayed it on the front end UI.
We have created a sample db and collection in mongo db for product catalog that we can use for this purpose. 
In the next step I tried to retrieve data from AWS through Node REST API calls which we will be using to retrieve data from product catalog db in the backend present in AWS. 
For trial purpose I have retrieved data from GrailsVersion2 app that I deployed in my AWS EC2 instance.
I have also written the code for storing data into local mongo db system.
I have developed a sample signup/register page in my Node Js project and when entered the details I wrote the code where the entered data in stored in mongo db of my local system. 
I am working on storing the data to RIAK Db which we are using for shopping cart.
I am also working on how to store the data in backend db which is RIAK in our case for shopping cart db using Node REST API calls.
Also I am trying to develop webpages using angular js for dynamic display of data on our front end.
