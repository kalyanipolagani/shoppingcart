As a part of my team's Front End Part, I have understood the project setup and how my nodejs app setup is going to look like. I have uploaded the notes which I have made in Misc/Kalyani folder of our projectâ€™s GitHub repository.
I have created sample app folder and created some HTML Templates and placed them in Views folder of app. I have learnt how to integrate my HTML templates with nodejs code. I have also written a code in Nodejs which performs CRUD operations on Mongo DB. 
In our project as a part of front end, we have to implement fetch operation from product catalog db and all the CRUD operations onto shopping cart Db. 
Next what I have done is, I started working on how REST API calls are handled in Nodejs. I have implemented the GET request to call Grails GumballVersion2 which I have deployed in my midterm lab. I have installed the npm node-rest-client manager and implemented the web requests in Nodejs. As a part of this week's presentation on Mongo dB, I have installed Mongo dB in EC2 AWS instances and implemented the CP of CAP theorem during partition. I am still working on handling the REST API calls. I came to know that designing dynamic web pages in AngularJs is very helpful. So next week I will work on that.
