As a part of my team's Front End Part, I have started my Express Node Project in Eclipse. 
I have uploaded the code and notes which I have made in Misc/Kalyani folder of our projectâ€™s GitHub repository. 
This week I have developed code for all necessary REST API calls for various modules needed to perform GET, PUT, POST and DELETE 
functions to backend databases mongo db and Riak database. I implemented those modules first on mongo db to retrieve data from backend 
and to display it on our frontend web page product catalog. Then I have implemented the REST calls on RIAK database present in backend 
to fetch and store and update values in shopping cart. I have developed checkout and login and other web pages of our team project.
I have integrated my modules with my teammate working on frontend. I and her have developed various functions required to be present in
shopping cart page like filters, checking items availability count before adding to cart, updating quantity of items in cart etc. 
I have also deployed my project code on heroku. I need to deploy the whole project code on heroku which I will be doing in the coming week. 
I have understood the Heroku functionalities and now I am comfortable with deploying code on Heroku.
