1. Worked on simple java riak client which can make basic create, read, update and delete operations. 

2. After discussing with the team, we have decided to use nodejs for both frontend and backend.
Hence we decided to discard existing java client and start working on nodejs for riak shopping cart store. 
Spent time on researching how exisiting node js client works with riak. 
Used basho github repository's node js client and use it to make CRUD operations.

3. Did a study on how riak supports built in rest API's and how riak's REST API's can be leveraged instead of building our own web services.
4. Completed an architecture plan of how shopping cart data would be stored in Riak and what services need to be exposed for the front end team to access the API's.
Decided on the structure of JSON object passed between frontend heroku and backend Riak.
{
"user_id": //to identify each user
"item_ids": //to identify each item added into the cart
"quantity": //to check if requested quantity is available from mongodb product catalog
"state": //state of cart: pending, checked out, shipping in progress etc
}
