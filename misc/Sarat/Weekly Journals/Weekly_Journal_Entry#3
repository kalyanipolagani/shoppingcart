1. Spent time deciding the shoppingcart Riak design on the backend.
As discussed in the previous week's team meeting, we decided on the JSON object format. 
Worked on designing the shoppingcart datastore schema for Riak. 

My architecture design:

Each shopping cart is identified by unique shopping cart identifier. This is choosen because a shoppingcart can be edited easily with the help of Unique cart ID.
Each shopping cart is attached to userid. Because all orders of a user can be fetched directly.
Each shopping cart has status. This indicates if cart is checked out/pending/shipping.
Each shopping cart has items (ofcourse). These are item codes whose product data is stored in MongoDB

2. Did a study on how riak replication occurs. It works as peer to peer hence mongoDB and Riak can be used in the same AWS instance running in different ports.
Replication is taken care by itself. Hence all nodes are put behind Elastic Load Balencer.

3. Worked on developing Riak Node js server to handle various shopping cart operations.
