I am working with Team #1 for project development of a "shoppingcart" system. I chose to work for the front end development using
Heroku.
The first step was to install heroku and the associated npm module along with the standard node-js compiler for windows.
Second was to configure npm , nodejs and heroku environment variables to that common commands such as "heroku create" and "node node.js"
could be easily executed from command line.
For the purpose of demonstration, I created a simple httpserver listening on port 8080 and when the url is accessed, a simple "Hello World"
message is displayed. 
Souce code for the server is given below:

"const http = require('http');

http.createServer( (request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  response.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(8080);

console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/');
"

After configuring heroku enviroment, I went through the heroku tutorial on https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction
and followed the steps to login to heroku server using my credentials.

cmd: heroku login

Heroku has a sample application  on repository which I then cloned using the following commands
cmd: git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git

The repo that was cloned contains the sample application as well as package.json which contains all the dependencies. These 
dependencies are resolved by doing a npm command to install the node modules that are required for the project.

cmd: npm install

Next step was to create an app on heroku which takes in all the source code from the repo and then deploy the app.

create command: heroku create

deploy command: git push heroku master

The deployment phase takes care of installing all the binaries and the dependencies.
Next step was to make sure that atleast one instance of the app is running by setting the ps:scale web value to 1
cmd: heroku ps:scale web = 1

Finally, we can open the app which is hosted at the following url
https://enigmatic-coast-33002.herokuapp.com/

Another intersting thing that I learned was the ProcFile defination. Procfile serves as an entry point which, for this app was 
the index.js file. 

Once the dependencies are resolved, we can deploy the app locally using 
cmd: heroku local web

Next step was to add some dependendies to the index.js , test locally, then push the changes.

cmd to add files to local git: git add .
cmd to commit changes:git commit -m "Demo"
cmd to deploy:git push heroku master
cmd to test: heroku open var

Objective for this week: add httpsockets and a database to heroku and add paths such as server/product/mens; server/product/womem
to create a web server shopping. Once that is accomplished, need to realizie a persistent shopping cart using node js and then deploy 
onto heroku
